During fall of 2025 I had the exciting opportunity to work with one of our professors, Amal Kabalan, on her research in biosensor production. Her team of researchers is identifying biomarkers in samples and had created a test apparatus they wanted to produce as an IC for further research use. They reached out to me to contract some CAD work as they were unfamiliar with the program necessary, KLayout. KLayout is used for the creation of GDS, aka GDSII file formats, which are used to mask layers of silicon or similar substrate materials for IC production later on.
