During our time working on the project, our team faced some not-so-insignificant
challenges. Speaking with other teams, it seems as though their
projects may have run a bit more smoothly, while we had a couple
sticking points that we needed to work out along the way.

One of these was the aforementioned team issue, both with attendance
and with commitment to the course. We found an issue early on where
all three of us were prioritizing our other, more difficult classes
and this commonly resulted in leaving work until the last minute.
One area this cropped up especially badly was within the user
interviews, an example of which can be seen alongside the section.
We were required to complete one of these per phase. This did not
exactly go to schedule - our first was completed during the second phase
and thus our other two interviews needed to be completed nearing
the end of the semester. Part of this issue was that we had a hard
time simply thinking of apt people to interview, but another key
sticking point was simply our team makeup. None of us are particularly
predisposed to conversating with people, so cold-calling businesses
or individuals to ask for their time was a scary task. As such this
got procrastinated significantly by all three of us and ended up
needing to be a discussion amongst us on how we could share this
workload and make it a little less frightening.

In the end there's really no simple solution to issues like these;
just ways one can ease the pain and help their teammates to a better
result. Supporting each other by providing resources and doing interviews
as a team ended up being two primary ways that we improved our
interviewing process, and these did make it a bit more bearable.
It did certainly teach me that while one can never truly get out
of doing things they dislike or are uncomfortable with, managing
that discomfort and completing the task despite it are key skills
to working in any sort of team.
