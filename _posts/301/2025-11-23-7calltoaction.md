Our class decided on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #3, "Good
Health and Well-Being". This is _such_ a wide field that my group had a tough
time nailing down what we thought we could make a significant impact on while
still remaining doable within the scope of one semester's design course.
We ended up deciding on, funnily enough, goal 3.1: **By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births**.

This stuck out to us as something that not only we could impact, but also something
that could directly impact us. As seen on the graph from Statista, the maternal
mortality ratio (MMR) in the USA is rising fairly rapidly compared to other
global nations. We felt that this close impact could help us better understand
the scope of our problem and further explore it as applicable to us.

Personally, I found the entirety of Goal #3 interesting as it was certainly
something new for me: my experiences so far have been very far from the medical
industry, even the MedTech industry. I found it engaging to have a new challenge
in an area I hadn't previously considered, and was looking forward to finding
a way to make meaningful change in real people's lives.
