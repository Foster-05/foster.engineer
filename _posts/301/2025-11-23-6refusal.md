As discussed previously, the medical field was very new for me at
the beginning of this class and therefore I had some significant
trepidation for the first week or two. Venturing into an entirely
new subject matter hadn't happened for me in a year-ish at this
point and I felt out of practice. Adding to that trepidation were
some key factors, including my (admittedly low) enjoyment of the class content
for the first phase, as well as my teammates.

I make it a goal to not rag on my teammates as much as possible,
because we're all peers and as such all deserve respect and the same
grace I would hope my classmates grant me. However, being the only
person in my group at the beginning of most class periods is not
entirely confidence-inspiring when I already am feeling nervous about
the project in general. The image shown is our peer evaluations from
the second phase of the project; I believe it illustrates how my fears
about my team have come true to some extent. However, my team did
improve greatly over the course of the class and I can't be more
grateful for their help.
