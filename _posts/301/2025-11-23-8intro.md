A reflection on ECEG 301, Praxis of Engineering Design, in the format of the Hero's Journey.

ECEG301 is designed to take students through the process start-to-finish of
ideating and creating an engineering design. To give some context, my group
landed upon heating blood samples for lateral flow assays to improve infection
detection and therefore positively impact the maternal mortality rate. We were
asked to create an ePortfolio to describe our personal experience through this
process in the format of the Hero's Journey, laid out below and in the illustration.
I hope that my reflection may give some insight into my mindset and thought
process throughout the project, as well as illustrate our project.
