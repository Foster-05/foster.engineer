<p>During fall of 2025 I had the exciting opportunity to work with one of our 
professors, Amal Kabalan, on her research in biosensor production. Her team 
of researchers is identifying biomarkers in samples and had created a test 
apparatus they wanted to produce as an IC for further research use. They 
reached out to me to contract some CAD work as they were unfamiliar with the 
program necessary, KLayout. KLayout is used for the creation of GDS, aka 
GDSII file formats, which are used to mask layers of silicon or similar 
substrate materials for IC production later on.</p>
