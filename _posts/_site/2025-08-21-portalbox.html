<p>The Portalbox is an open-source makerspace management project. It originated at Bucknell University and intends to spread worldwide, allowing makerspaces to control their
equipment and their users as they see fit. The Portalbox focuses on using interlocks to control power to equipment, such as 3D printers or laser cutters, based on the RFID
cards that each student possesses. I had the honor to work on v5 of the Portalbox over the summer of 2025.</p>

<p>Our team consisted of myself, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aiden-cherniske/">Aiden Cherniske</a>, a Computer Engineering major in the Class of 2027,
and our makerspace director Matt Lamparter (<strong>mlampart@bucknell.edu</strong>) overseeing. Some of our goals for our new version of the Portalbox included shrinking the physical
footprint, saving cost on manufacturing each box, changing components for clarity and ease of use, and overall making the Portalbox more complete and consistent as a
product. We accomplished all of these goals, shrinking the board area by roughly 50%, switching several components to save on manufacturing cost and increase component
reliability, and creating a cleaner case and UI for users to interact with. The Finite State Machine running the Portalbox was also significantly improved by our resident
coder, and rethought to allow for more hardware options and reduce processing time.</p>

<p>Part of my work on this project included completely redesigning the schematic and PCB for the Portalbox, taking what the Senior Design team before us left and updating 
components for reliability and cost. I was able to create a more efficient layout that only required 12cm by 8cm of board space, significantly shrinking the layout compared
to previous iterations. I also created a new modular case design that allows for both laser-cut or 3D printed components. This allows as many makerspaces as possible to be
able to produce cases in-house, significantly easing the requirements to create a Portalbox. It also allows others to design and test their own case components, in the spirit
of the open-source nature of the project. All KiCad and SOLIDWORKS files are available on our public GitHub repo.</p>

<p>The time I spent (and continue to spend) on the Portalbox have greatly improved my skills and interest in the Embedded Hardware field~ I interacted with several new-to-me
technologies and significantly improved my intuition and skills in circuit design. Creating more than six revisions of the board allowed me to fully understand the board’s
behavior, as well as debug and improve my layout and routing in between each production. We ended up producing and populating three of our revisions before reaching a 
production model.</p>

<p>I’m so thankful for my time working on the project, and am looking forward to seeing the project evolve and grow in the future!</p>
