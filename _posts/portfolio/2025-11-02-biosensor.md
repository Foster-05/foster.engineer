During fall of 2025 I had the exciting opportunity to work with one of our 
professors, Amal Kabalan, on her research in biosensor production. Her team 
of researchers is identifying biomarkers in samples and had created a test 
apparatus they wanted to produce as an integrated circuit for further research 
use utilizing electrodes to stimulate samples placed into the IC. They 
reached out to me to contract some CAD work as they were unfamiliar with the 
program necessary, KLayout. KLayout is used for the creation of .gds, aka 
GDSII file formats, which are used to mask layers of silicon or similar 
substrate materials for IC production later on. This venture into VLSI and IC 
design is super exciting for me, as it's something not really ever covered
by my university or offered as a concentration or course of study. This opportunity
to join Professor Kabalan in designing an IC for production was therefore
very exciting and one I eagerly jumped at. While this component is extremely 
simple and was designed fairly quickly, it's an important step towards 
more complex design, even dipping into the VLSI range, despite this being simply 
integrated design, not very-large-scale integrated design. Designing for her allowed me to
not only familiarize myself with KLayout, but gain experience in precise design 
for applications with tight tolerances, learn about VLSI-specific design, and 
assist in creation of a product that will hopefully assist their research team
for several years to come. I hope to continue in my learning and venture further
into VLSI and IC design!
