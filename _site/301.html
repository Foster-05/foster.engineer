<p>ECEG301 is designed to take students through the process start-to-finish of
ideating and creating an engineering design. To give some context, my group
landed upon heating blood samples for lateral flow assays to improve infection
detection and therefore positively impact the maternal mortality rate. We were
asked to create an ePortfolio to describe our personal experience through this
process in the format of the Hero’s Journey, laid out below and in the illustration.
I hope that my reflection may give some insight into my mindset and thought
process throughout the project, as well as illustrate our project.</p>

                    <div class="lead"><p>Our class decided on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #3, “Good
Health and Well-Being”. This is <em>such</em> a wide field that my group had a tough
time nailing down what we thought we could make a significant impact on while
still remaining doable within the scope of one semester’s design course.
We ended up deciding on, funnily enough, goal 3.1: <strong>By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births</strong>.</p>

<p>This stuck out to us as something that not only we could impact, but also something
that could directly impact us. As seen on the graph from Statista, the maternal
mortality ratio (MMR) in the USA is rising fairly rapidly compared to other
global nations. We felt that this close impact could help us better understand
the scope of our problem and further explore it as applicable to us.</p>

<p>Personally, I found the entirety of Goal #3 interesting as it was certainly
something new for me: my experiences so far have been very far from the medical
industry, even the MedTech industry. I found it engaging to have a new challenge
in an area I hadn’t previously considered, and was looking forward to finding
a way to make meaningful change in real people’s lives.</p>

                    <div class="lead"><p>As discussed previously, the medical field was very new for me at
the beginning of this class and therefore I had some significant
trepidation for the first week or two. Venturing into an entirely
new subject matter hadn’t happened for me in a year-ish at this
point and I felt out of practice. Adding to that trepidation were
some key factors, including my (admittedly low) enjoyment of the class content
for the first phase, as well as my teammates.</p>

<p>I make it a goal to not rag on my teammates as much as possible,
because we’re all peers and as such all deserve respect and the same
grace I would hope my classmates grant me. However, being the only
person in my group at the beginning of most class periods is not
entirely confidence-inspiring when I already am feeling nervous about
the project in general. The image shown is our peer evaluations from
the second phase of the project; I believe it illustrates how my fears
about my team have come true to some extent. However, my team did
improve greatly over the course of the class and I can’t be more
grateful for their help.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Challenges</h2>
                    <div class="lead"><p>During our time working on the project, our team faced some not-so-insignificant
challenges. Speaking with other teams, it seems as though their
projects may have run a bit more smoothly, while we had a couple
sticking points that we needed to work out along the way.</p>

<p>One of these was the aforementioned team issue, both with attendance
and with commitment to the course. We found an issue early on where
all three of us were prioritizing our other, more difficult classes
and this commonly resulted in leaving work until the last minute.
One area this cropped up especially badly was within the user
interviews, an example of which can be seen alongside the section.
We were required to complete one of these per phase. This did not
exactly go to schedule - our first was completed during the second phase
and thus our other two interviews needed to be completed nearing
the end of the semester. Part of this issue was that we had a hard
time simply thinking of apt people to interview, but another key
sticking point was simply our team makeup. None of us are particularly
predisposed to conversating with people, so cold-calling businesses
or individuals to ask for their time was a scary task. As such this
got procrastinated significantly by all three of us and ended up
needing to be a discussion amongst us on how we could share this
workload and make it a little less frightening.</p>

<p>In the end there’s really no simple solution to issues like these;
just ways one can ease the pain and help their teammates to a better
result. Supporting each other by providing resources and doing interviews
as a team ended up being two primary ways that we improved our
interviewing process, and these did make it a bit more bearable.
It did certainly teach me that while one can never truly get out
of doing things they dislike or are uncomfortable with, managing
that discomfort and completing the task despite it are key skills
to working in any sort of team.</p>
