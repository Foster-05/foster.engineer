		<p>Perhaps the most challenging aspect of the project for my group was truly
narrowing down what we wanted to focus on. Our subject was so broad
that we struggled for some time figuring out what our product would
look like, who it would serve, and what purpose it would have in
the larger landscape of maternal mortality.</p>

<p>This can clearly be seen by one of our primary representations, the
sytem map: it started out very large and directionless, highlighting
several options, none of which were especially great. Later on in
the project, we were able to add some blocks to more accurately
represent the section we were focusing on, as well as stick to
highlighting the one loop that our project would place the most emphasis on.</p>

<p>It was certainly an up-and-down journey to reach this later system
map: we didn’t get straight what our actual goal was until fairly
late in the project, while we were already looking at components
and functional choices. Going through the process of fully fleshing
out our idea with representations did help us move towards that final
concept, but it wasn’t until we were forced to face <em>how</em> we would
make that a reality that it truly came into full form.</p>

<p>To me, all this really stresses is the importance of forethought
and extensive planning. All of the representations we created in
the earlier phases of the project did help move us towards our
final concept, but it’s clear from this hurdle that it wasn’t enough.
In the future we need to ensure that when we say we’re done with representations,
it needs to be in such a way that we could immediately create an
MVP or similar representation. Component choices and further thought
needs to happen <em>before</em> we end up getting to this point!</p>
